	5. Create a function called checkIfPassed which will be able to check if you passed by checking the percentage of your score against the passing percentage.
		- this function should take 2 numbers as an argument, your score and the total score.
		- First, get the percentage of your score against the total. You can look up the formula to get percentage.
		- Using a relational operator, check if your score percentage is greater than 75, the passing percentage. Save the value of the comparison in a variable called isPassed.
		- return the value of the variable isPassed.
		- This function should return a boolean.

		Create a global variable called outside of the function called isPassingScore.
			-This variable should be able to receive and store the boolean result of the checker function.
			-Log the value of the isPassingScore variable in the console.
