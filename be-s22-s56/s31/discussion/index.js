// [Section] Objects
/*
    - An object is a data type that is used to represent real world objects
    - It is a collection of related data and/or functionalities
    - In JavaScript, most core JavaScript features like strings and arrays are objects (Strings are a collection of characters and arrays are a collection of data)
    - Information stored in objects are represented in a "key:value" pair
    - A "key" is also mostly referred to as a "property" of an object
    - Different data types may be stored in an object's property creating complex data structures
*/

// Creating objects using Object() class
// Object() is a built-in class in JavaScript that allows creation of an object
// The "new" operator signals creation of a new instance of the Object class that will be stored inside myComputer variable
// instance refer to a copy of a blueprint that lets the dev create multiple copies of a class
// The created instance is an empty object
let myComputer = new Object();
console.log(myComputer)
console.log(typeof myComputer)
// Creating another empty object
let computer = {}

// Creating objects using object initializers/literal notation
/*
    - This creates/declares an object and also initializes/assigns it's properties upon creation
    - A cellphone is an example of a real world object
    - It has it's own properties such as name, color, weight, unit model and a lot of other things
    - Syntax
        let objectName = {
            keyA: valueA,
            keyB: valueB
        }

// Creating objects using a constructor function
/*
    - Creates a reusable function to create several objects that have the same data structure
    - This is useful for creating multiple instances/copies of an object
    - An instance is a concrete occurence of any object which emphasizes on the distinct/unique identity of it
    - Syntax
        function ObjectName(keyA, keyB) {
            this.keyA = keyA;
            this.keyB = keyB;

}

// This is a unique instance of the Laptop object
/*
    - The "new" operator creates an instance of an object
    - Objects and instances are often interchanged because object literals (let object = {}) and instances (let object = new object) are distinct/unique objects

/*
    - The example above invokes/calls the "Laptop" function instead of creating a new object instance
    - Returns "undefined" without the "new" operator because the "Laptop" function does not have a return statement

// [Section] Accessing Object Properties

// Using the dot notation
console.log('Result from dot notation: ' + myLaptop.name);

// Accessing array of objects
/*
    - By using the dot notation, this easily helps us differentiate accessing elements from arrays and properties from objects
    - Object properties have names that makes it easier to associate pieces of information
*/

// Differentiation between accessing arrays and object properties
// This tells us that array[0], which is the first element in the array, is an object by using the dot notation

// [Section] Initializing/Adding/Deleting/Reassigning Object Properties
/*
    - Like any other variable in JavaScript, objects may have their properties initialized/added after the object was created/declared
    - This is useful for times when an object's properties are undetermined at the time of creating them
*/

// [Section] Object Methods
/*
    - A method is a function which is a property of an object
    - They are also functions and one of the key differences they have is that methods are functions related to a specific object
    - Methods are useful for creating object specific functions which are used to perform tasks on them
    - Similar to functions/features of real world objects, methods are defined based on what an object is capable of doing and how it should work
