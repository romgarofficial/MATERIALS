// [Section] While Loop
/*
    - A while loop takes in an expression/condition
    - Expressions are any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value
    - If the condition evaluates to true, the statements inside the code block will be executed
    - A statement is a command that the programmer gives to the computer
    - A loop will iterate a certain number of times until an expression/condition is met
    - "Iteration" is the term given to the repetition of statements
    - Syntax
        while(expression/condition) {
            statement
        }
*/

/*
let count = 5;

// While the value of count is not equal to 0
while(count !== 0) {

    // The current value of count is printed out
    console.log("While: " + count);

    // Decreases the value of count by 1 after every iteration to stop the loop when it reaches 0
    // Loops occupy a significant amount of memory space in our devices
    // Make sure that expressions/conditions in loops have their corresponding increment/decrement operators to stop the loop
    // Forgetting to include this in loops will make our applications run an infinite loop which will eventually crash our devices
    // After running the script, if a slow response from the browser is experienced or an infinite loop is seen in the console quickly close the application/browser/tab to avoid this
    count--;

}
*/

// [Section] Do While Loop
/*
    - A do-while loop works a lot like the while loop. But unlike while loops, do-while loops guarantee that the code will be executed at least once.
    - Syntax
        do {
            statement
        } while (expression/condition)
*/

/*
    - The "Number" function works similarly to the "parseInt" function
    - Both differ significantly in terms of the processes they undertake in converting information into a number data type and other features that help with manipulating data
    - The "prompt" function creates a pop-up message in the browser that can be used to gather user input
    - How the Do While Loop works:
        1. The statements in the "do" block executes once
        2. The message "Do While: " + number will be printed out in the console
        3. After executing once, the while statement will evaluate whether to run the next iteration of the loop based on given expression/condition (e.g. number less than 10)
        4. If the expression/condition is not true, another iteration of the loop will be executed and will be repeated until the condition is met
        5. If the expression/condition is true, the loop will stop
*/

/*
let number = Number(prompt("Give me a number"));

do {

    // The current value of number is printed out
    console.log("Do While: " + number);

    // Increases the value of number by 1 after every iteration to stop the loop when it reaches 10 or greater
    // number = number + 1
    number += 1;

// Providing a number of 10 or greater will run the code block once and will stop the loop
} while (number < 10)
*/

// [Section] For Loop
/*
    - A for loop is more flexible than while and do-while loops. It consists of three parts:
        1. The "initialization" value that will track the progression of the loop.
        2.  The "expression/condition" that will be evaluated which will determine whether the loop will run one more time.
        3. The "finalExpression" indicates how to advance the loop.
    - Syntax
        for (initialization; expression/condition; finalExpression) {
            statement
        }
*/

/*
    - Will create a loop that will start from 0 and end at 20
    - Every iteration of the loop, the value of count will be checked if it is equal or less than 20
    - If the value of count is less than or equal to 20 the statement inside of the loop will execute
    - The value of count will be incremented by one for each iteration
*/

/*
for (let count = 0; count <= 20; count++) {

    // The current value of count is printed out
    console.log(count);

// Individual characters of a string may be accessed using it's index number
// The first character in a string corresponds to the number 0, the next is 1 up to the nth number

    - Creates a loop that will print out the letters of the name individually and print out the number 3 instead when the letter to be printed out is a vowel
    - How this For Loop works:
        1. The loop will start at 0 for the the value of "i"
        2. It will check if "i" is less than the length of myName (e.g. 0)
        3. The if statement will check if the value of myName[i] converted to a lowercase letter is equivalent to any of the vowels (e.g. myName[0] = a, myName[0] = e, myName[0] = i, myName[0] = o, myName[0] = u)
        4. If the expression/condition is true the console will print the number 3.
        5. If the letter is not a vowel the console will print the letter
        6. The value of "i" will be incremented by 1 (e.g. i = 1)
        7. Then the loop will repeat steps 2 to 6 until the expression/condition of the loop is false

// [Section] Continue and Break statements
/*
    - The "continue" statement allows the code to go to the next iteration of the loop without finishing the execution of all statements in a code block
    - The "break" statement is used to terminate the current loop once a match has been found

    - Creates a loop that if the count value is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, it will print the number and continue to the next iteration of the loop
    - How this For Loop works:
        1. The loop will start at 0 for the the value of "count".
        2. It will check if "count" is less than the or equal to 20.
        3. The "if" statement will check if the remainder of the value of "count" divided by 2 is equal to 0 (e.g 0/2).
        4. If the expression/condition of the "if" statement is "true" the loop will continue to the next iteration.
        5. If the value of count is not equal to 0, the console will print the value of "count".
        6. The second if statement will check if the value of "count" is greater than 10. (e.g. 0)
        7. If the expression/condition of the second "if" statement is false the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
        8. The value of "count" will be incremented by 1 (e.g. count = 1)
        9. Then the loop will repeat steps 2 to 8 until the expression/condition of the loop is "false" or the condition of the second "if" statement (e.g. name[0] > 10) is true, the loop will stop due to the "break" statement
