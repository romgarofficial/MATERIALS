**Summary:**

The project involves making styling modifications to HTML elements within a web page. It covers different aspects of styling, including inline styling, internal and external CSS, font properties, background colors, borders, alignment, and more. The project will also utilize Git for version control to track and push the changes made.

**Scope:**

The scope of the project includes the following objectives:

- Create a new folder named "activity" within the "S07" folder and add an "index.html" file inside it. Copy the template code from Boodle notes and paste it into the "index.html" file. Update the local Git repository and push the changes with the commit message "Add template code s07."

- Apply inline styling to a paragraph tag and change its text color to red using the HTML color red.

- Add an internal CSS and apply internal styling to a paragraph tag by adding an ID attribute called "internal." Change the text color to orange using the HTML color orange.

- Create an "index.css" file. Apply external styling to a paragraph tag by adding an ID attribute called "external." Create a CSS ruleset in the external CSS file and use the ID selector to change the text color to yellow using the HTML color yellow.

- Change the font-family and font-size of all elements on the web page using the universal selector. Set the font to "Verdana, sans-serif" and the font size to 20 pixels.

- Change the font-size of all h1 tags using a type selector. Set the font-size to 3 rem.

- Change the text to uppercase for all h2 tags using an ID selector. Add an ID attribute called "sub-header" and transform the text to uppercase using CSS.

- Change the background colors of the "languages to be learned" list items using a class selector. Add a class called "text-green" and use the class selector to update all elements with the "text-green" class to have a green background using the HTML color green.

- Change the border of the "tools to be used" list items using attribute selectors. Add a class called "border-blue" to the list items and use attribute selectors to update all elements with the "border-blue" class to have a 2-pixel solid blue border using the HTML color blue.

- Remove the list style type of the "other things to be learned" list using an adjacent sibling selector. Select the ul element itself using an adjacent sibling selector.

- Change the dimensions of the image tag within the section using a descendant selector. Select the image element inside the section and change its height and width to 20 viewport height units (20vh). Set a border-radius of 100 pixels.

- Change the alignment of the last paragraph using a general sibling selector. Select the general sibling paragraph element of the "other things to be learned" list and center its text.

- Change the letter spacing of the "other things to be learned" list items using a child selector. Specify the list items that are children of a ul element, which is also a child of a section. Add a letter spacing of 10 pixels.

- Check out each feature to a Git branch using the command "git checkout -b <branchName>."
Update the local Git repository and push the changes with the commit message "Add activity code s07."

- Add the sessions repository link in Boodle for the "s07" activity.
