# Reminders to Instructors

## Before and During Presentation

- Prepare your note-taking tool before the start of the class.
- Prepare the Boodle tab in your web browser for output grading.
- Make sure that the URL of each student's project (along with user credentials, if applicable) is captured either through Boodle or another note-taking medium.
- Regularly remind the students of the time limit to keep their presentations short and concise.

## Tips

- Let all the students present their work first, then give general feedback to the class. Give specific feedback to each student after class based on your notes.
- Apply the sandwich approach of giving feedback: positive comments, followed by points for improvement, then positive comments again.
