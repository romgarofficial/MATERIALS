# Instructor Notes

- Coordinate with Instructor SV/OICs regarding the orientation that the bootcampers will undergo during this session:
    - HR Orientation (conducted by career advisors)
    - Bootcamp Orientation (conducted by you, the instructor)
- Ensure that all bootcampers have successfully installed the software needed for the bootcamp.
    - Links to the installation guides can be found in your batch timeline sheet.
- Putting dashes in naming certain things (such as files, folders, etc.) is recommended over underscores for a variety of reasons:
    - In SEO, URLs with underscores treats two or more words as one.
    - When highlighting a URL from a web browser, the highlight stops at a hyphen but does not stop in underscores.
    - To learn more, go to the [style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) of Google Developer Documentation for more information.
