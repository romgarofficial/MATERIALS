# Resources

## Instructional Materials

- [Google Slide Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L6solhoi5BFAdsMwRxRg1ru_0e1RsWMXDEGgrIo-Ub4)
- [Sample CSP1 Project](https://teejaecalinao.github.io/charles-sample/)

Hide the link of the sample from the students by setting the browser to full-screen so that they cannot visit the site themselves.

Alternatively, clone the sample project to your local machine and show the page.

  - Custom web page font style using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
