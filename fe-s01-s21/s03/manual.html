Discussion
========== 
-->

<!-- 
1. Create a "discussion" folder and an "index.html" file.
	Batch Folder > individual > s03 > discussion >  index.html
-->

		<!-- Manual Code -->
		<html>
			<head>
			    <title></title>
			</head>
			<body>

			</body>
		</html>

		<!-- Sublime Text 3 Autocomplete -->
		<!-- html + "Tab" key -->
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
			    <meta charset="utf-8">
			    <title></title>
			</head>
			<body>

			</body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- Demonstrate the use of HTML tags first by manually typing the code block. You may opt to show the students how to autocomplete HTML code. Though this is recommended towards the latter part of the discussion for better retainment of codes used in the discussion.
			- If the code was generated using autocomplete, indent the contents of the html tag for code readability. This can be can be done using the following:
				- Select the contents of the head tag by clicking and dragging to the closing body tag.
				- Pressing on the "Tab" key to move the selected code block one indentation to the right.
				- Pressing on the "Shift" key + "Tab" key will do the opposite.
			- Make sure that the students save the file as a ".html" extension for the autocomplete feature of sublime text editor to work.
			- If the file was not saved with the ".html" extension, you may rename the file and change the linting of the sublime text editor on the lower right hand side which contains the words "Plain Text" or "HTML". This is responsible for autocompletion of code based on the programming language selected. ".html" file extensions are normally opened with HTML and ".txt"/no file extensions are opened with "Plain Text".
			- The "index.html" file is important because it serves as the entry point of the application. In most programming languages, the "index" file is the first file to be run by an application. This is also very important in the context of hosting an application in Git.
			- "Hosting" refers to making our project available online and generating a live link that will serve as the "hosted/online" version of a project.

<!-- 
2. Add the title of the page.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <head>
		        <title>HTML Introduction</title>
		    </head>
		    <body>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
			Important Note:
				- <html> tag - tells the browser to read the contents of the file as HTML.
				- <head> tag - contains the details of the HTML file not visible in the browser.
				- <title> tag - sets the title of the tab shown in the browser.
				- <body> tag - contains the actual content of the HTML file that are visible to the browser.
				- HTML normally come in pairs and are called "paired tags". The opening and the closing tags.
				- For every change in the file, show the students the changes by opening the "index.html" file in the browser.
				- Opening the file in the browser can be done using the following:
					- File Explorer > Right click + index.html > Open with Other Application > Google Chrome
					- File Explorer + Double click + index.html
					- Sublime Text Editor > index.html + Right click > Open in Browser
		-->

<!-- 
3. Add a comment.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <head>
		    	<!-- Changes the title of the page -->
		        <title>HTML Introduction</title>
		    </head>
		    <body>
		    </body>
		</html>
	
		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- Comments are useful for proper documentation and allows us developers to understand written code better.
			- These are ignored by the browser and do not show as text.
			- Comments may be done using the following:
				Linux and Windows = Click on the line of code to be commented out + ctrl + / (forward slash)
				Mac = Click on the line of code to be commented out + cmd + / (forward slash)
			- For code blocks, you can highlight portions of the code by holding the left click and dragging to sections to be commented.
			- Make sure that the file has been saved for the changes to be applied to the output.
			- A saved file will have an "x" symbol on the right side of the file name in the tabs located at the top of the sublime text editor if it is saved. 
			- A "circle" symbol will show instead if there are unsaved changes to a file.
			- Saving the file can be done using the following:
				- File > Save
				- Linux and Windows = ctrl + s
				- Mac = cmd + s
			- For any succeeding changes to the file and if it's already opened in a browser, showing the changes can be done using the following:
				- Browser > index.html > Click on the URL/Link + "Enter" key
				- Browser + F5

<!-- 
4. Add a header tag.
	Application > index.html 
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		    	<!-- Creates a heading text -->
		        <h1>Zuitt Coding Bootcamp</h1>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <h1> tag - Creates a heading text element that's larger in size and is had a bolder text. Header tags create block elements. This can be proven because the text occupies the full width of the page/container. HTML elements added after this tag will show below it and not beside the element.
			- Refer to "references" section of this file to find the documentation for a list of block and inline elements.
			- HTML tags are the code we use to generate elements. Elements are the items that we see in the browser.
		-->

<!-- 
4. Add another header tag.
	Application > index.html
-->
		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		    	<!-- ... -->
		        <h1>Zuitt Coding Bootcamp</h1>

		        <!-- Creates a smaller heading text -->
		        <h3>John Doe</h3>
		    </body>
		</html>

<!-- 
5. Create a hr tag.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		    	<!-- ... -->
		        <h3>John Doe</h3>

		        <!-- Creates a horizontal rule -->
		        <hr>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <hr> tag - Creates a horizontal rule element. hr tags create block elements.
			- hr tags are "single" tags also called as "self closing" tags.
		-->

<!-- 
6. Add a paragraph tag.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		        <!-- ... -->
		        <hr>

		        <!-- Creates a paragraph text -->
		        <!-- Introductory paragraph -->
		        <p>Welcome to Zuitt! In this online bootcamp course, you will learn a lot of things. Let's enumerate all the things that will make you a full-stack web developer.</p>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <p> tag - creates paragraph elements. Paragraph tags create block elements.
			- If the text/code line exceeds the width of the editor and creates a horizontal scrolling at the bottom, you may set the sublime text editor to use word wrapping.
				- View > Word Wrap
		-->

<!-- 
7. Add an emphasis tag.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		        <!-- ... -->
		        <!-- Introductory paragraph -->
		        <!-- em creates emphasis on text -->
		        <p>Welcome to <em>Zuitt</em>! In this online bootcamp course, you will learn a lot of things. Let's enumerate all the things that will make you a full-stack web developer.</p>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <em> tag - changes the style of a text into italics for emphasis. em tags create inline elements. This can be proven because the text appears inside of the paragraph element.
			- <i> tag - functions in the same manner but the usage for each element is different.
			- Refer to "references" section of this file to find the documentation on the differences for each element. Not recommended to be discussed due to the concept of semantic HTML tags.
		-->

<!-- 
8. Add a strong tag.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		        <!-- ... -->
		        <!-- em creates emphasis on text -->
		        <!-- strong creates importance on text -->
		        <p>Welcome to <em>Zuitt</em>! In this online bootcamp course, you will learn a lot of things. Let's enumerate all the things that will make you a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong>.</p>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <strong> tag - changes the style of a text into bold for importance. strong tags create inline elements.
			- <b> tag - functions in the same manner but the usage for each element is different.
			- Refer to "references" section of this file to find the documentation on the differences for each element. Not recommended to be discussed due to the concept of semantic HTML tags.
		-->

<!-- 
9. Add a br tag.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		        <!-- ... -->
		        <!-- strong creates importance on text -->
		        <!-- br creates a line break in between text -->
		        <p>
		        	Welcome to <em>Zuitt</em>!
		        	<br>
		        	In this online bootcamp course, you will learn a lot of things. Let's enumerate all the things that will make you a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong>.
		       	</p>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <br> tag - produces a line break in text.
			- br tags are not meant to be used for manipulating the style and layout of a page. This is added in the discussion to show awareness to the students that this tag exists.
			- Inform the students that "paired" tags don't necesarily have to be in the same line to work. Using this format when adding HTML tags fosters code readability.
		-->

<!-- 
9. Add an unordered list.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->
		    <body>

		        <!-- ... -->
		        <p>
		         	<!-- ... -->
		        </p>

		        <!-- Creates an unordered list with bullet points -->
		        <ul>
		        	<!-- Creates a list item -->
		            <li>Languages</li>
		            <li>Frameworks & Libraries</li>
		            <li>Tools</li>
		        </ul>
		    </body>
		</html>

		<!-- 
		Important Note:
			- <ul> tag - creates a bulleted list of elements. Unordered list tags create block elements.
			- <li> tag - creates list item elements for the specified list. Used together with the <ul> or <ol> tags.
		-->

<!-- 
10. Add an unordered nested list.
	Application > index.html
-->

		<html>
		    <!-- ... -->

		        <p>
		            The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The
		            clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these
		            aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the
		            aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the
		            aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the
		            details form a cohesive code.
